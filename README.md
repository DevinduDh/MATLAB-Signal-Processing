```
Error using plot
Vectors must be the same length.

```

Reason for this error is that number of elements in X axis is not equal to nmber of elements in Y axis or viseversa.

Ex: Lets say you have 10 X values but have only 6 corresponding Y values.In this case you are unable to plot because you dont know some Y values for corresponding X value. The same thing goes with MATLAB.
